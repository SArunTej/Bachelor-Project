        <p align="justify"> <font size="4">Using Cloud Storage, users can remotely store their data and enjoy the on-demand high quality applications and
services from a shared pool of conﬁgurable computing resources, without the burden of local data storage and maintenance.
However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in
Cloud Computing a formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources. Moreover, users should be able
to just use the cloud storage as if it is local, without worrying about the need to verify its integrity. Thus, enabling public auditability
for cloud storage is of critical importance so that users can resort to a third party auditor (TPA) to check the integrity of outsourced
data and be worry-free. To securely introduce an effective TPA, the auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards
user data privacy, and introduce no additional online burden to user. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud storage system
supporting privacy-preserving public auditing. We further extend our result to enable the TPA to perform audits for multiple users
simultaneously and efﬁciently. Extensive security and performance analysis show the proposed schemes are provably secure
and highly efﬁcient.</p>
